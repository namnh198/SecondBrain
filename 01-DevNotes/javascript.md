## Miscellaneous
- Using `//` for 1 line comment, `/* */` for multi-line comments
- JS can be execute without `;` but it's minified need to be `;`
- Variable and function name are case sensitive
- Variables/functions should be names with format camel case (`nameOfVariable`)
	- Name a constant: `const FAV_PET = 'Cat'`
	- `UpperCamelCase` should be used by conversion for ES6 class names.
- Using `\` for special characters, for example `\"` for `"` inside double quote
## Practice directly on the browser
Open the browser (I use `Brave`), press `F12` to open *Inspect* window, then choose tab `Console`. Now you can practice on this console window, for example, try with `console.log("Hello World")` end press `Enter`
## ES6
- "ES" = "**E**CM**S**cript" ~ "Javascript"
- Most of browser use ES6 but not all
- ES6 = ES2015
- New feature: `Arrow Function`, `Classes`, `Modules`, `Promise`, `Generator`, `let` and `const`
- Read more about ES on w3schools.
