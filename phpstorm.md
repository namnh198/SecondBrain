## Indexing Options
### Limit CPU Usage
By default, PHPStorm allows full CPU usage (100%). Therefore the CPU is overloaded
- For indexing only
Go to: Help -> Edit Custom Properties	
```shell frame="none"
caches.indexerThreadsCount=4 
caches.scanningThreadsCount=4
```
- For all (Include Search Files,...)
Go to: Help → Edit Custom VM Options
```shell frame="none"
-XX:ActiveProcessorCount=4
```
### Directories Exclude and Ignore Files
To improve performance, please exclude and ignore some directories and files that don’t use to scan & index (Such as log file, symlink,…)
- **Directories exclude:** File → Setting → Directories → Select unused folder to exclude
- **Ignore files:** File → setting → Editor → File Types → Ignore Files and Folder → Add a new record
**P/S**: If you have multiple project with the same platform. You can use shared indexes for these one
**Go to:** File → Setting → Tools → Shared Indexes → Enable “Wait for shared indexes” (Updated: From Version PhpStorm 2023.3.1 it has been changed PHP Composer Packaged → Download Automatically)
